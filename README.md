<H1>Group Name : Tob Tob Tob</H1>

<H2>Project Goals :</H2>

The primary goal of this project is to apply object-oriented programming principles to solve a real-world problem. The key objectives are:

- To Digitize Manual Processes: Replace inefficient manual scheduling methods (like whiteboards or logbooks) with a robust digital solution.

- To Centralize Information: Create a single, authoritative source for all prayer duty schedules, accessible to authorized staff.

- To Ensure Data Integrity: Minimize human errors such as double-bookings or missed assignments through a structured management system.

- To Provide Secure Access: Implement a user authentication system to ensure only authorized personnel can modify schedules.

- To Demonstrate OOP Concepts: Effectively apply the four pillars of OOP (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Abstraction, Polymorphism) in the application's design.


<H2>Features</H2>

- Secure User Login: Staff must log in with a valid User ID and Password.

- View Schedules: All current prayer schedules are displayed in a clear, easy-to-read list upon login.

- Add New Schedules: Easily add new duties with details like date, prayer type, role, and the assigned person's name using a simple form.

- Edit Existing Schedules: Select any schedule from the list to modify its details.

- Delete Schedules: Remove schedules that are no longer needed, with a confirmation step to prevent accidental deletion.

- Data Persistence: All staff and schedule data is saved locally to .txt files, so information is never lost between sessions.
